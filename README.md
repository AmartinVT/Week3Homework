Code Explaination
---
This project is a random password generator web application. The user clicks the "Generate Password" button to launch the application.

The user is then prompted to enter the desired password length. The app requires the length to be between 8 and 128 characters, otherwise the user is alerted of the error and the application restarts.

Once the user enters a valid length, the user is then prompted to customize the password criteria.

The first prompt asks if there can be uppercase letters.

The second prompt asks if there can be lowercase letters.

The third prompt asks if there can be numbers.

The fourth prompt asks if there can be special characters.
